      <listitem>
        <para>The .got section may hold the Global Offset Table (GOT). This
        section is not normally present in a relocatable object file because it
        is linker generated. The linker must ensure that .got is aligned to an
        8-byte boundary. In an executable or shared library, it may contain
        part or all of the TOC. For more information, see
        <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655240___RefHeading___Toc377640591" /> and

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The .toc section may hold the initialized TOC. The .toc section
        must be aligned to an 8-byte boundary. Address elements within .toc
        must be aligned to 8-byte boundaries to support linker optimization of
        the .toc section. In a relocatable object file, .toc may contain
        addresses of objects and functions; in this respect it may be thought
        of as a compiler-managed GOT. It may also contain other constants or
        variables; in this respect it is like .sdata. In an executable or
        shared library, it may contain part or the entirety of the TOC. For
        more information, see

        <para>The .plt section may hold the procedure linkage table. This
        section is not normally present in a relocatable object file because it

        address. The linker must ensure that .plt is aligned to an 8-byte
        boundary. For more information, see

    <para>Tools that support this ABI are not required to use these sections.
    However, if a tool uses these sections, it must assign the types and
    attributes specified in 
    <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_64556" />. Tools are not required to use
    the sections precisely as suggested. Relocation information and the code
    that refers to it define the actual use of a section.</para>

    <title>TOC</title>
    <para>The TOC is part of the data segment of an executable program.</para>
    <para>This section describes a common layout of the TOC in an executable
    file or shared object. Particular tools are not required to follow the
    layout specified here.</para>
    <para>The TOC region commonly includes data items within the .got, .toc,
    .sdata, and .sbss sections. In the medium code model, they can be addressed
    with 32-bit signed offsets from the TOC pointer register. The TOC pointer
    register typically points to the beginning of the .got section + 0x8000,
    which permits a 2 GB TOC with the medium and large code models. The .got
    section is typically created by the link editor based on @got relocations.
    The .toc section is typically included from relocatable object files
    referenced during the link phase.</para>
    <para>The TOC may straddle the boundary between initialized and
    uninitialized data in the data segment. The common order of sections in the
    data segment, some of which may be empty, follows:</para>
    <programlisting>.rodata
.data
.data1
.got
.toc
.sdata
.sbss
.plt
.bss1
.bss</programlisting>
    <para>The medium code model is expected to provide a sufficiently large TOC
    to provide all data addressing needs of a module with a single TOC.</para>
    <para>Compilers may generate two-instruction medium code model references
    (or, if selected, short displacement one-instruction references) for all
    data items that are in the TOC for the object file being compiled. Such
    references are relative to the TOC pointer register, r2. (The linker may
    optimize two-instruction forms to one instruction forms, replacing a first
    instruction of the two instruction form with a nop and rewriting the second
    instruction. Consequently, the TOC pointer must be live during the first
    and second instruction of a two-instruction reference.)</para>
    <para>&#160;</para>
    <bridgehead>Modules Containing Multiple TOCs</bridgehead>
    <para>The link editor may create multiple TOCs. In such a case, the
    constituent .got, .toc, .sdata, and .sbss sections are conceptually
    repeated as necessary, with each TOC typically using a TOC pointer value
    of its base plus 0x8000. Any constituent section of type SHT_NOBITS in
    any TOC but the last is converted to type SHT_PROGBITS filled with
    zeros.</para>
    <para>When multiple TOCs are present, linking must take care to save,
    initialize, and restore TOC pointers within a single module when calling
    from one function to a second function using a different TOC pointer
    value. Many of the same issues associated with a cross-module call apply
    also to calls within a module but using different TOC pointers.</para>

    <section xml:id="dbdoclet.50655241_95185">
      <title>Symbol Values</title>
      <para>An executable file that contains a symbol reference that is to be
      resolved dynamically by an associated shared object will have a symbol
      table entry for that symbol. This entry will identify the symbol as
      undefined by setting the st_shndx member to SHN_UNDEF.</para>
      <para>The OpenPOWER ABI uses the three most-significant bits in the
      symbol st_other field to specify the number of instructions between a
      function's global entry point and local entry point. The global entry
      point is used when it is necessary to set up the TOC pointer (r2) for the
      function. The local entry point is used when r2 is known to already be
      valid for the function. A value of zero in these bits asserts that the
      function does not use r2.</para>
      <para>The values of these three most significant bits of the st_other
      field have the following meanings:</para>
      <informaltable frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0">
        <tgroup cols="2">

              <entry>
                <para>The local and global entry points are the same, and the
                function has a single entry point with no requirement on r12 or
                r2. On return, r2 will contain the same value as at
                entry.</para>
                <para>This value should be used for functions that do not
                require the use of a TOC register to access external data. In
                particular, functions that do not access data through the TOC
                pointer can use a common entry point for the local and global
                entry points.</para>
                <note>
                  <para>If the function is not a leaf function, it must
                  call subroutines using the R_PPC64_REL24_NOTOC relocation
                  to indicate that the TOC register is not initialized. In
                  turn, this may lead to more expensive procedure linkage
                  table (PLT) stub code than would be necessary if a TOC
                  register were initialized.</para>

      <title>Use of the Small Data Area</title>
      <para>For a data item in the .sdata or .sbss sections, a compiler may
      generate short-form one-instruction references. In an executable file or
      shared library, such a reference is relative to the address of the TOC
      base symbol (which can be obtained from r2 if a TOC pointer is
      initialized). A compiler that generates code using the small data area
      should provide an option to select the maximum size of objects placed in
      the small data area, and a means of disabling any use of the small data
      area. When generating code for ELF shared libraries, the small data area
      should not be used for default-visibility global objects. This is to
      satisfy ELF shared-library symbol interposition rules. That is, an
      ordinary global symbol in a shared library may be overridden by a symbol
      of the same name defined in the executable or another shared library.
      Supporting interposition when using TOC-pointer relative addressing would
      require text relocations.</para>

    <title>Relocation Types</title>
    <para>The relocation entries in a relocatable file are used by the link
    editor to transform the contents of that file into an executable file or a
    shared object file. The application and result of a relocation are similar
    for both. Several relocatable files may be combined into one output file.
    The link editor merges the content of the files, sets the value of all
    function symbols, and performs relocations.</para>
    <para>The 64-bit OpenPOWER Architecture uses Elf64_Rela relocation entries
    exclusively. A relocation entry may operate upon a halfword, word, or
    doubleword. The r_offset member of the relocation entry designates the
    first byte of the address affected by the relocation. The subfield of
    r_offset affected by a relocation is implicit in the definition of the
    applied relocation type. The r_addend member of the relocation entry serves
    as the relocation addend, which is described in 
    <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_45722" /> for each relocation type.</para>
    <para>A relocation type defines a set of instructions and calculations
    necessary to alter the subfield data of a particular relocation
    field.</para>

      <para>In the following figure, half16ds is similar to half16, but is
      really just 14 bits because the two least-significant bits must be zero
      and are not really part of the field. (Used by, for example, the ldu
      instruction.) In addition to the use of this relocation field with the DS
      forms, half16ds relocations are also used in conjunction with DQ forms.
      In those instances, the linker and assembler collaborate to create valid
      DQ forms. They raise an error if the specified offset does not meet the
      constraints of a valid DQ instruction form displacement.</para>

                <para>Represents the section offset or address of the procedure
                linkage table entry for the symbol. This implies the creation
                of a .plt section if one does not already exist. It also
                implies the creation of a procedure linkage table (PLT) entry
                for resolving the symbol. For an unresolved symbol, the PLT
                entry points to a PLT resolver stub. For a resolved symbol, a
                procedure linkage table entry holds the final effective address
                of a dynamically resolved symbol (see

      <title>Relocation Descriptions</title>
      <para>The following list describes relocations that can require special
      handling or description.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_GOT16*</para>
      <para>These relocation types are similar to the corresponding
      R_PPC64_ADDR16* types. However, they refer to the address of the symbol’s
      GOT entry and instruct the link editor to build a GOT.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_PLTGOT16*</para>
      <para>These relocation types are similar to the corresponding
      R_PPC64_GOT16* types. However, if the link editor 
      <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> determine the actual value of the symbol, the
      GOT entry may contain the address of an entry in the procedure linkage
      table. The link editor creates that entry in the procedure linkage table
      and stores that address in the GOT entry. This permits lazy resolution of
      function symbols at run time. If the link editor 
      <emphasis>can</emphasis> determine the value of the symbol, it stores that
      value in the corresponding GOT entry. The link editor may generate an
      R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT relocation as usual.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_PLTREL32, R_PPC64_PLTREL64</para>
      <para>These relocations indicate that reference to a symbol should be
      resolved through a call to the symbol’s procedure linkage table entry.
      Additionally, it instructs the link editor to build a procedure linkage
      table for the executable or shared object if one is not created.</para>
      <para><anchor xml:id="dbdoclet.50655241_R_PPC_COPY" xreflabel="" />R_PPC64_COPY</para>
      <para>This relocation type is created by the link editor for dynamic
      linking. Its offset member refers to a location in a writable segment.
      The symbol table index specifies a symbol that should exist both in the
      current relocatable file and in a shared object file. During execution,
      the dynamic linker copies data associated with the shared object’s symbol
      to the location specified by the offset.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT</para>
      <para>This relocation type allows determination of the correspondence
      between symbols and GOT entries. It is similar to R_PPC64_ADDR64.
      However, it sets a GOT entry to the address of the specified
      symbol.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_JMP_SLOT</para>
      <para>This relocation type is created by the link editor for dynamic
      linking. Its offset member gives the location of a procedure linkage
      table (PLT) entry. The dynamic linker modifies the PLT entry to transfer
      control to the designated symbol’s address (see 
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655242_20388" />).</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_RELATIVE</para>
      <para>This relocation type is created by the link editor for dynamic
      linking. Its offset member gives a location within a shared object that
      contains a value representing a relative address. The corresponding
      virtual address is computed by the dynamic linker. It adds the virtual
      address at which the shared object was loaded to the relative address.
      Relocation entries for this type must specify 0 for the symbol table
      index.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_IRELATIVE</para>
      <para>The link editor creates this relocation type for dynamic linking.
      Its addend member specifies the global entry-point location of a resolver
      function returning a function pointer. It is used to implement the
      STT_GNU_IFUNC framework. The resolver is called, and the returned pointer
      copied into the location specified by the relocation offset
      member.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_TLS, R_PPC64_TLSGD, R_PPC64_TLSLD</para>
      <para>Used as markers on thread local storage (TLS) code sequences, these
      relocations tie the entire sequence with a particular TLS symbol. For
      more information, see 
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_90241" />.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_TOCSAVE</para>
      <para>This relocation type indicates a position where a TOC save may be
      inserted in the function to avoid a TOC save as part of the PLT stub
      code. A nop can be emitted by a compiler in a function's prologue code. A
      link editor can change it to a TOC pointer save instruction. This marker
      relocation is placed on the prologue nop and on nops after bl
      instructions, with the symbol plus addend pointing to the prologue nop.
      If the link editor uses the prologue to save r2, it may omit r2 saves in
      the PLT call stub code emitted for calls marked by
      R_PPC64_TOCSAVE.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_UADDR*</para>
      <para>These relocation types are the same as the corresponding
      R_PPC64_ADDR* types, except that the datum to be relocated is allowed to
      be unaligned.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_ADDR64_LOCAL</para>
      <para>When a separate local entry point exists, this relocation type is
      used to initialize a memory location with the address of that local entry
      point.</para>
      <para>R_PPC64_REL24_NOTOC</para>
      <para>This relocation type is used to specify a function call where the
      TOC pointer is not initialized. It is similar to R_PPC64_REL24 in that it
      specifies a symbol to be resolved. However, if the symbol is resolved by
      inserting a call to a PLT stub code, the PLT stub code must not rely on
      the presence of a valid TOC base address in TOC register r2 to reference
      the PLT function table.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Assembler Syntax</title>
      <para>The offset from .TOC. in the GOT where the value of the symbol is
      stored is given by the assembly syntax symbol@got. The value of the
      symbol alone is the address of the variable named symbol.</para>
      <para>For example:</para>
      <programlisting>addis  r3, r2,x@got@ha
ld     r3,x@got@l(r3)</programlisting>
      <para>Although the Power ISA only defines 16-bit displacements, many TOCs
      (and hence a GOT) are larger then 64 KB but fit within 2 GB, which can be
      addressed with 32-bit offsets from r2. Therefore, this ABI defines a
      simple syntax for 32-bit offsets to the GOT.</para>
      <para>The syntaxes SYMBOL@got@ha, SYMBOL@got@h, and SYMBOL@got@l refer to
      the high adjusted, high, and low parts of the GOT offset. (For an
      explanation of the meaning of “high adjusted,” see
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_18894" />). SYMBOL@got@ha corresponds to
      bits 32 - 63 of the offset within the global offset table with adjustment
      for the sign extension of the low-order offset bits. SYMBOL@got@l
      corresponds to the 16 low-order bits of the offset within the global
      offset table.</para>
      <para>The syntax SYMBOL@toc refers to the value (SYMBOL - .TOC.), where
      .TOC. represents the TOC base for the current object file. This provides
      the address of the variable whose name is SYMBOL as an offset from the
      TOC base.</para>
      <para>As with the GOT, the syntaxes SYMBOL@toc@ha, SYMBOL@toc@h, and
      SYMBOL@toc@l refer to the high adjusted, high, and low parts of the TOC
      offset.</para>
      <para>The syntax SYMBOL@got@plt may be used to refer to the offset in the
      TOC of a procedure linkage table entry stored in the global offset table.
      The corresponding syntaxes SYMBOL@got@plt@ha, SYMBOL@got@plt@h, and
      SYMBOL@got@plt@l are also defined.</para>
      <para> </para>
      <note>
        <para>
        If X is a variable stored in the TOC,
        then X@got is the offset within the TOC of a doubleword whose
        value is X@toc.</para>
      </note>
      <para>The special symbol .TOC. is used to represent the TOC base for the
      current object file.</para>
      <para>The following code might appear in a PIC code setup sequence to
      compute the distance from a function entry point to the TOC base:</para> 
      <programlisting>addis  2,12,.TOC.-func@ha
addi   2,2,.TOC.-func@l</programlisting>      
      <para>The syntax 
      <literal>SYMBOL@localentry</literal> refers to the value of the local
      entry point associated with a function symbol. It can be used to
      initialize a memory word with the address of the local entry point as
      follows:</para>
      <programlisting>.quad  func@localentry</programlisting>

    <title>Assembler- and Linker-Mediated Executable Optimization</title>
    <para>To optimize object code, the assembler and linker may rewrite object
    code to implement the function call and return conventions and access to
    global and thread-local data. It is the responsibility of compilers and
    programmers to generate assembly programs and objects that conform to the
    requirements as indicated in this section.</para>
    <section xml:id="dbdoclet.50655241_69294">
      <title>Function Call</title>
      <para>The static linker must modify a nop instruction after a bl function
      call to restore the TOC pointer in r2 from 24(r1) when an external symbol
      that may use the TOC may be called, as in 
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655240_88555" />. Object files must contain a
      nop slot after a bl instruction to an external symbol.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Reference Optimization</title>
      <para>References to the GOT may be optimized by rewriting indirect
      reference code to replace the reference by an address computation. This
      transformation is only performed by the linker when the symbol is known
      to be local to the module.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Displacement Optimization for TOC Pointer Relative
      Accesses</title>
      <para>Assemblers and linkers 
      <emphasis>may</emphasis> optimize TOC reference code that consists of two
      instructions with equivalent code when offset@ha is 0.</para>
      <para>TOC reference code:</para>
      <programlisting>addis  rt, r2, offset@ha
lwz    rt, offset@l(rt)</programlisting>

      <para>Compilers and programmers 
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> ensure that r2 is live at the actual data access
      point associated with extended displacement addressing.</para>

      <section xml:id="dbdoclet.50655241_19147">
        <title>TOC Pointer Usage</title>
        <para>To enable linker-based optimizations when global data is accessed,
        the TOC pointer needs to be available for dereference at the point of all
        uses of values derived from the TOC pointer in conjunction with the @l
        operator. This property is used by the linker to optimize TOC pointer
        accesses. In addition, all reaching definitions for a TOC-pointer-derived
        access must compute the same definition.</para>
        <para>In some implementations, non-ABI-compliant code may be processed by
        providing additional linker options; for example, linker options
        disabling linker optimization. However, this behavior in support of
        non-ABI-compliant code is not guaranteed to be portable and supported in
        all systems.</para>

      <title>TLS Background</title>
      <para>Most C/C++ implementations support (as an extension to earlier
      versions of the language) the keyword __thread to be used as a
      storage-class specifier in variable declarations and definitions of data
      objects with thread storage duration. (The 2011 ISO C Standard uses
      _Thread_local as the keyword, while the 2011 ISO C++ Standard uses
      thread_local.) A variable declared in this manner is automatically
      allocated local to each thread. Its lifetime is defined to be the entire
      execution of the thread. Any initialization value is assigned once before
      thread startup.</para>

      <para>A thread-local variable is completely identified by the module in
      which it is defined, along with the offset of the variable relative to

      <para>The relocation specifier @got@tprel in the first instruction causes
      the link editor to generate a GOT entry with a relocation that the
      dynamic linker will replace with the offset for x relative to the thread
      pointer. The relocation specifier x@tls tells the assembler to use an r13
      form of the instruction. That is, add r9,r9,r13 in this case, and tag the
      instruction with a relocation that indicates it belongs to a TLS
      sequence. This relocation specifier can be used later by the link editor
      when optimizing TLS code.</para>
      <para>To read the contents of the variable instead of calculating its
      address, the add r9, r9, x@tls instruction might be replaced with lwzx
      r0, r9, x@tls.</para>

      <para>Given the following code fragment, three different relocation
      sequences may be used, depending on the size of the offset to the
      variable. The sequence in 
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_45954" /> handles offsets within 60 KB
      relative to the end of the TCB (where r13 points 28 KB past the end of
      the TCB, which is immediately before the first TLS block). The sequence
      in 
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_47421" /> handles offsets past 60 KB and
      less than 2 GB + 28 KB relative to the end of the TCB. The third sequence
      is identical to the Initial Exec sequence shown in
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_17435" />.</para>

      <title>ELF TLS Definitions</title>
      <para>The result of performing a relocation for a TLS symbol is the
      module ID and its offset within the TLS block. These are then stored in
      the GOT. Later, they are obtained by the dynamic linker at run-time and
      passed to __tls_get_addr( ), which returns the address for the variable
      for the current thread.</para>
      <para>For more information, see 
      <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50655241_18894" />. For TLS relocations, see

      <title>Back Chain</title>
      <para>Systems must provide a back chain by default, and they must include
      compilers allocating a back chain and system libraries allocating a back
      chain. Alternate libraries may be supplied in addition to, and beyond,
      but never instead of those providing a back chain. Code generating and
      using a back chain shall be the default for compilers, linkers, and
      library selection.</para>

      <title>Nested Functions</title>
      <para>Nested functions that access their ancestors’ stack frames are
      entered with r11 initialized to an environment pointer. The environment
      pointer is typically a copy of the stack pointer for the most recent
      instance of the nested function's parent's stack frame. When a function
      pointer to a nested function referencing its outer context is created, an
      implementation may create a trampoline to load the present environment
      pointer to r11, followed by an unconditional branch to the function code
      of the nested function contained in the text segment.</para>
      <para>When a trampoline is used, a pointer to a nested function is
      represented by the code address of the trampoline.</para>
      <para>In some environments, the trampoline code may be created by
      allocating memory on the data stack, making at least pages containing
      trampolines executable. In other environments, executable pages may be
      prohibited in the stack area for security reasons.</para>
      <para>Alternate implementations, such as creating code stacks for
      allocating nested function trampolines, may be used. In garbage-collected
      environments, yet other ways for managing trampolines are
      available.</para>

      <title>Traceback Tables</title>
      <para>To support debuggers and exception handlers, the 64-bit

      debug and unwind information that enables flexible debugging and
      unwinding of optimized code (such as, for example, DWARF).</para>
      <para>To support legacy tooling, the 
      <citetitle>OpenPOWER ELF V2 ABI</citetitle> also specifies the use of a

      <para>

      they are not specified in the current ABI definition.</para>
